# -Basic-Weather-App
A Python-based weather app can be developed to retrieve and display real-time weather information for a specific location. The app typically integrates with a weather API, processes the retrieved data, and presents it in an accessible format, either through a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).
